    "In this chapter we will introduce a deep learning approach for Differential Emission Measure (DEM) Inversion. <i>For this notebook</i>, `DeepEM` is a trained on one set of <i>SDO</i>/AIA observations (six optically-thin channels; 6 x N x N) and DEM solutions (in 18 temperature bins from log$_{10}$T = 5.5 - 7.2, 18 x N x N; [Cheung et al 2015](https://doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/807/2/143)) at a resolution of 512 x 512 (N = 512) using a 1x1 2D Convolutional Neural Network with a single hidden layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DeepEM` method presented here takes every DEM solution with no regards to the quality or existence of the solution. As will be demonstrated, when this method is trained with a single set of <i>SDO</i>/AIA images and DEM solutions, `DeepEM` solutions have a similar fidelity to Sparse Inversion (with a significantly increased computation speed—on the order of 10 million DEM solutions per second), and additionally, `DeepEM` finds positive solutions at every pixel, and reduced noise in the DEM solutions.\n",
